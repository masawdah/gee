# Google Earth Engine (GEE)

It is very hard to go through all of the huge amount of data from different sources, and sometimes it takes so much time by submit a request and wait the response to download a few scenes and images as well as check every day for a new image through the sources to update the study or the research , and then decide which is better for the analysis and what is the best for the study area, it takes so much time. 


Often it turns out to be more efficient to move the questions than to move the data (Jim gray). The previous sentence describe very well the power of google earth engine, because google earth engine provide a huge amount of images from different sources such as Landsat and Sentinel to do the analysis on them by cloud without downloading them, the amazing part you do not want to do the geoprocessing using your machine (good news for slow machine) you need just to send a request for google engine server about the geoprocessing tool or algorithm that you want to perform and they will send you the result in no time.


Also, every day there will be new images but you do not want to check them, just every day going and just in one click, google engine will do everything automatically and the algorithm will run automatically including the new images in the analysis and send a new results. Google engine makes it possible and easy to build a monitoring system for the different environment purposes such as the vegetation using a huge a mount of daily images by analysis and store them using a very modern and fast servers and provide the updated results for the user in an active and easy way.
